Task 1: Implementing Form Submission and Reset

Description: Add functionality to the user registration form created in Task 1 to submit the data to a mock service and reset the form after submission. Use Angular's HttpClient module to send a POST request to JSONPlaceholder's '/users' endpoint.


Task 2: Creating a User Registration Form

Description: Create a basic user registration form with fields for first name, last name, email, and password. Validate the input for each of these fields. Ensure that the name fields only contain alphabetic characters, the email field contains a valid email address, and the password field meets a minimum length requirement. Display appropriate error messages if the input is invalid. Disable the submit button if the form is invalid.
