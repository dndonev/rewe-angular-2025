Title: Angular Login Flow Implementation

Description:

Your task is to create a basic login flow in Angular. This flow should be capable of handling user authentication.

Requirements:

Setup the Angular application: Create a new Angular application using Angular CLI. Make sure to add Angular Routing to the application.

Create necessary components: Create the following components:

LoginComponent: This component should include a form for username and password, and a button to submit the form.

DashboardComponent: This is the landing page after successful login. Display a simple welcome message with the username and a logout button.

AppComponent: This is your root component. Implement routing to either LoginComponent or DashboardComponent based on the login state.
Create a service for user authentication:

AuthService: This service should have methods for login, logout, and to check the current login status. You can mock the authentication with a hardcoded list of users.
Implement the Login Flow:

On form submit in LoginComponent, call AuthService to validate user credentials.
If the credentials are valid, redirect the user to DashboardComponent and save the login state.
If the credentials are not valid, display an error message in LoginComponent.
Implement the Logout Flow:

On the click of the logout button in DashboardComponent, call AuthService to change the login state and then redirect the user to LoginComponent.
Extras:

Implement form validation: The form should not be submitted if the fields are empty or if the input does not match certain conditions (such as a specific length, the presence of certain characters, etc.)
Implement Guard: Create an AuthGuard that prevents navigation to DashboardComponent if the user is not logged in.
Deliverables:

An Angular application codebase fulfilling the above requirements.

Remember, when dealing with user information and passwords, never store passwords in plain text in a production application. This simple task uses hard-coded mock data, but in a real-world application, you would use secure practices for storing and comparing passwords.
